Answer to 2. 
Fusion goes to App Base directory to find assemblies, if some of related assemblies not found in application base directory,
so fusion goes to assembly name sub-directory, in my case my dll name is ShapeLib.dll so if i create the sub - directory calls "ShapesLib" (like says exercise),
i got the "File Not Found" exception. But if i renaming directory to "ShapeLib" -  app working properly, because sub-directory is same as my dll.

Answer to 3.
As i can see from "fuslogvw.exe" tool, there is some legal directories that Fusion can search for assemblies, no one of them contains "Bin",
so this path need to be added to App.config file in <probing> section, this is the way to locate assemblies that are in different name sub-directories.

Full path for Ordinary Assemblies:

1. Application base directory. - In my case before i moved the "ShapesLib.dll"
2. Assembly name sub-directory. - In my case from my first answer. If i create same name sub-directory - app should work properly.
3. <probing> directory. Like in my second answer, after i added "Bin" directory to config file, application working properly.
